# Walmart Sales Forecasting Project Overview

This project aims to predict Walmart store sales across various seasons and holidays to help the company manage inventories, forecast revenue, and plan effective campaigns. Accurate forecasting will enable Walmart to make informed decisions on stock arrangements, revenue projections, and investment planning, which is especially crucial given the seasonal fluctuation in sales patterns.
Problem Statement

Walmart experiences significant fluctuations in sales due to seasonal effects. Failing to predict these seasonal peaks or troughs can lead to potential revenue loss and negatively impact stock prices. This project focuses on building predictive models to forecast weekly sales across Walmart stores, considering factors like holiday promotions, markdowns, CPI, temperature, fuel prices, and more.
Project Objectives

    Data Understanding and Cleaning
        Identify missing values and handle them (imputation or removal).
        Format date columns appropriately.
        Explore relationships among markdowns, temperature, CPI, unemployment, and sales.
        Detect and address outliers or data quality issues.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        Identify seasonal sales patterns and trends.
        Examine sales performance across stores, departments, and holidays.
        Visualize the distribution of sales and analyze external factors affecting sales.

    Feature Engineering and Preparation for Modeling
        Engineer features like lag variables, rolling averages, and holiday sales indicators.
        Encode categorical variables (e.g., store type, holiday flags).
        Scale continuous features for effective model training.

    Model Development
        Train machine learning models (Random Forest, ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to forecast sales.
        Evaluate models using Weighted Mean Absolute Error (WMAE), emphasizing holiday-related sales accuracy.

    Findings and Interpretations
        Identify top-performing stores and departments in seasonal periods.
        Recommend strategies for inventory and stock management based on model predictions.

Data Description

The dataset contains weekly sales data for various Walmart stores. Important columns include:

    Date: Date of the sales record.
    Store and Department: Identifiers for each store and department.
    Sales: Weekly sales figures for each department in each store.
    IsHoliday: Indicates if the sales week includes a holiday.
    Markdowns: Promotional markdowns applied.
    CPI, Fuel_Price, Temperature, Unemployment: External economic factors.

Model Selection

Several models were explored in this project to account for Walmart's non-stationary, seasonal data:

    Random Forest Regressor: Selected features based on feature importance, achieving a Weighted Mean Absolute Error (WMAE) of approximately 1801.
    ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing: Applied log transformations and shifting techniques to enhance stationarity. Exponential Smoothing achieved the lowest error of 821, making it suitable for trend forecasting.

Key Findings

    Seasonal Patterns: Sales peak during major holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Black Friday), with lower sales in January due to reduced spending after holiday seasons.
    Store and Department Variability: Sales vary significantly by store type (A, B, C), with larger stores generally experiencing higher seasonal sales.
    Holiday Impact: The 51st week, aligning with pre-Christmas shopping, sees substantial sales, suggesting that holiday promotions should begin earlier.
    External Factors: Economic indicators like CPI, temperature, and unemployment have minimal impact on weekly sales, though more data could refine these insights.

Future Improvements

    Refine stationarity techniques and introduce advanced feature engineering.
    Incorporate additional holiday data to improve model sensitivity to special occasions.
    Explore separate models for high-demand stores or departments.
    Conduct a market basket analysis to determine department-wise demand trends.
